This is my "local port repository" for use with MacPorts, containing among others the co-installable Qt4 and Qt5 ports that I'm currently working on.

To "install", clone to a location of choice. My original is in the root of the MacPorts prefix: /opt/local/site-ports; let's say you want to do the same:

%> sudo -u macports git clone --depth=1 --no-single-branch http://github.com/RJVB/mp-port-repository.git /opt/local/site-ports

Then, edit ${prefix}/etc/macports/sources.conf (${prefix} is where MacPorts is installed; by default it's /opt/local). Towards the end of the file, add a line *above* the line that has [default] at the end:

file:///opt/local/site-ports

and save the file. If you do not want this repository to be updated automatically whenever you do port selfupdate or port sync, you'll want to add [nosync] at the end of the line you added.

Now, do

%> (cd /opt/local/site-ports ; portindex)

and the new ports will be available. Ports that are in my repository but are also in the default repository will override those in the default repository (and all other repositories listed after site-ports in sources.conf).

NB: this repository also contains PortGroup definitions. These apply only to the ports in the local repository. If you want them to apply to all ports (e.g. qt4-1.0.tcl or qt5-1.0.tcl and qmake5-1.0.tcl), you'll have to copy the corresponding files from the _resources directory to the one in the default port tree. You will have to do this again after each selfupdate.
