port:zlib has been installed with CloudFlare's performance modifications except
the support for the PCLMUL instruction set that would have changed the license.
These modifications are made available publicly by CloudFlare at
https://github.com/cloudflare/zlib
without explicit copyright or licensing information. They have been downloaded
directly from the repository while port:zlib was being built on @@HOST@@
to avoid potential/unwritten restrictions on redistributing the modified sources.
(commit @@COMMIT@@ was used.)
