PortSystem 1.0

name            gccas
version         1.0
description     a modern wrapper to use the clang assembler instead of GNU/Apple as

set clang "/usr/bin/clang"
foreach cdv {3.6 3.7 3.8 3.9 4.0} {
    set cv [join [split ${cdv} "."] ""]
    variant clang${cv} description "Use clang-mp-${cv} from port:clang-${cdv} as the default" {}
    if {[variant_isset clang${cv}]} {
        depends_run-append  port:clang-${cdv}
        set clang "${prefix}/bin/clang-mp-${cdv}"
    }
}

long_description This is a wrapper around the clang assembler that allows to call it \
                in lieu and place of the `as` command (= Apple's version of GNU as, gas). \
                It's name is taken from the old gccas tool that mimicked gas for use by \
                the llvm-gcc front-end. The purpose remains the same: being able to \
                use GCC compilers as a front-end for the LLVM assembler/linker toolchain \
                with the goal of having access to the full x86_64 instruction set from \
                those compilers (which include gfortran).\
                By default the wrapper will invoke ${clang}\; this can be overriden using \
                the CLANG_ASSEMBLER shell variable.
