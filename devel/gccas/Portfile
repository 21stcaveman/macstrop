PortSystem 1.0

name            gccas
version         1.1
description     a to make GNU/Apple as use clang's internal assembler

long_description This is a wrapper around the clang assembler that allows to call it \
                in lieu and place of the `as` command (= Apple's version of GNU as, gas). \
                Its name is taken from the old gccas tool that mimicked gas for use by \
                the llvm-gcc front-end. The purpose remains the same: being able to \
                use GCC compilers as a front-end for the LLVM assembler/linker toolchain \
                with the goal of having access to the full x86_64 instruction set from \
                those compilers (which include gfortran).\
                By default the wrapper will invoke `${prefix}/bin/as -q`\; this can be overriden using \
                the CLANG_ASSEMBLER shell variable.
