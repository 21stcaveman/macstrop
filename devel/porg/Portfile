description         management of software packages installed from source code.
long_description    Porg (formerly known as paco), is a program to aid management \
                    of software packages installed from source code. After the \
                    installation of such packages, one is usually left with having \
                    no idea of what it was installed and where it all went, making \
                    it difficult to uninstall the package in the future. Porg was \
                    written to solve this problem in a quite simple fashion.
