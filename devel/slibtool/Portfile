description     a skinny libtool implementation, written in C
long_description \
                slibtool is an independent reimplementation of the widely used libtool, \
                written in C. slibtool is designed to be a clean, fast, easy-to-use \
                libtool drop-in replacement (when invoked as rlibtool), \
                and is accordingly aimed at package authors, \
                distro developers, and system integrators. slibtool maintains compatibility \
                with libtool in nearly every aspect of the tool's functionality as well as \
                semantics, leaving out (or turning into a no-op) only a small number of \
                features that are no longer needed on modern systems.
