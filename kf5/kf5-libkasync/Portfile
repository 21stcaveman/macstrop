description         API to help write async code.
long_description    KASync is based around jobs that take lambdas to execute asynchronous tasks. \
                    Each async operation can take a continuation that can then be used to execute \
                    further async operations. That way it is possible to build async chains of \
                    operations that can be stored and executed later on. Jobs can be composed, \
                    similarly to functions.
